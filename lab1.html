                    <h2><i>Casablanca</i> - 1941</h2>
                    <p>Widely considered one of the greatest movies of all time, <i>Casablanca</i> definitely lives up to this reputation. Set in the namesake city in French Morocco during the early years of World War II, this movie follows American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) as he struggles to run his popular nightclub amid pressure from the French police, under command of the Nazi forces. Rick's life is further complicated when his former lover, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), appears with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is an Allied collaborator wanted by the Nazis. Rick must decide whether to help Ilsa and Laszlo escape Casablanca, or turn Laszlo in and rekindle his relationship with Ilsa.</p>

                    <h2><i>The Graduate</i> - 1967</h2>
                    <p>Mike Nichols' generational classic, <i>The Graduate</i> is every bit as entertaining today as it was back in 1967. The movie follows the story of Benjamin Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman. Benjamin is the embodiment of every young adult of the 1960s and even today: confused. On his return to Los Angeles from going to college in the east, Benjamin realizes that he has no idea what to do with his life. Feeling that no one understands him, he is thrown into an affair with the much older wife of his father's business partner, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). As Benjamin attempts to figure out where he is meant to be, his forced date with the Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), teaches him that he is not alone in his struggle.</p>
